# 🏡 AutoAI_HousePricePrediction
AI-based house price prediction model using IBM Watson Studio AutoAI.
This project uses IBM Watson Studio AutoAI to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, year built, and more.

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to accurately predict house prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. IBM Watson AutoAI automates the model building process and selects the best algorithm based on performance.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies Used
- IBM Watson Studio
- IBM AutoAI
- Python (for integration & preprocessing)
- Google Colab (optional for notebook experimentation)
- GitHub (for version control)
- CSV Dataset (structured tabular data)

## 🗂 Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following features:
- Date
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Sqft Living
- Sqft Lot
- Floors
- Waterfront
- View
- Condition
- Sqft Above
- Sqft Basement
- Year Built
- Year Renovated
- Street, City, StateZip, Country

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Dataset was uploaded to IBM Watson Studio.
2. AutoAI handled:
   - Data cleaning
   - Feature selection
   - Algorithm comparison
   - Hyperparameter tuning
3. The best model was selected based on R² score.
4. The model was deployed and tested for new predictions.

## 🧠 Model/Algorithm Used
IBM AutoAI automatically selected the best algorithm (e.g., Gradient Boosting or XGBoost) based on performance. The final model achieved an R² score of **0.89**.

## 📈 Output and Impact
The model was able to make predictions on new data with high accuracy. It can assist in:
- Real estate valuation
- Property investment analysis
- Smart pricing for sellers

## ✅ Conclusion
The IBM Watson AutoAI platform provided a robust and automated solution to develop an accurate house price prediction model without manual coding of ML pipelines.
